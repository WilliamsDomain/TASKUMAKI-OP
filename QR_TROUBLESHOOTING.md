# QR Code Troubleshooting Guide

## 🔍 Why QR Code Might Not Work

### Common Issues:

1. **WhatsApp Web Changes**: WhatsApp frequently updates their web interface
2. **Session Conflicts**: Another WhatsApp Web session might be active
3. **Network Issues**: Firewall or proxy blocking the connection
4. **Browser Cache**: Old cached data interfering

## 🛠️ Solutions

### Method 1: Phone Number Code (Recommended)

1. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
2. Enter your phone number (e.g., +1234567890)
3. Click "📱 Get 8-Digit Code"
4. Use the 8-digit code in WhatsApp:
   - Open WhatsApp on your phone
   - Go to Settings > Linked Devices
   - Tap "Link a Device"
   - Enter the 8-digit code

### Method 2: Clear WhatsApp Sessions

1. Open WhatsApp on your phone
2. Go to Settings > Linked Devices
3. Log out from all devices
4. Try scanning the QR code again

### Method 3: Use QR Code File

1. The bot saves QR code as `qr-code.svg` in the project folder
2. Open this file in your browser
3. Scan the larger, clearer QR code

### Method 4: Manual WhatsApp Web

1. Open `https://web.whatsapp.com` in your browser
2. Scan the QR code there
3. If it works, the issue is with the bot's QR code generation

## 🔧 Technical Solutions

### If QR Code Still Doesn't Work:

1. **Update Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm update whatsapp-web.js
   ```

2. **Clear Session Data**:

   ```bash
   rm -rf ./sessions
   ```

3. **Try Different Browser**:

   - Use Chrome instead of Firefox
   - Disable browser extensions

4. **Check Network**:
   - Disable VPN/proxy
   - Check firewall settings
   - Try different network

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when you see:

- "✅ WhatsApp Group Manager Bot is ready!" in terminal
- Bot responds to `/help` command in groups
- Web interface shows "Connected" status

## 📱 Alternative Login Methods

1. Check the terminal for error messages
